**FACT:**

*   PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE!

**MYTH:**

*   Babies do not need Bum Cream.

**FACT:**

*   A **GOOD BUM CREAM** forms a protective barrier between the delicate skin of a babyâ€™s bum and the soiled nappy.
*   **Apply on clean, dry skin with EVERY diaper change.**

**MYTH:**

*   Diapers ONLY need to be changed 6-8 hourly or when properly soiled.

**FACT:**

*   Wet and soiled nappies can irritate the delicate skin and within a few hours a rash can appear. So change regularly!

**MYTH**:

*   Using ONLY wipes is fine.

**FACT:**

*   A soft lukewarm wet cloth with mild Baby wash/shampoo used at least twice every 12 hours works wonders to leave a bum clean and fresh! Pat dry and GIVE IT AIR for a few minutes! Remember that bum is covered with a nappy 24/7!!!!  
      
    

**MYTH**:

*   The most expensive Bum Cream can heal any nappy rash.

**FACT**:

*   **NO** Bum Cream will heal a Candida Nappy rash ( red spots becoming little blisters and forming open sores)
*   Candida is a fungal infection and need to be treated with a clotrimazole cream.
*   Remember to continuously use this cream for a month even if the rash has disappeared. A fungus has a spore that needs to be treated properly otherwise it will flare up and the rash will even worsens.
