  From a tiny cluster of cells smaller than a grain of rice, baby grows for over
  9 months to fill your belly and take up every inch of your heart.

Make time to pamper yourself, eat nutritious meals, rest while baby sleeps and relaxing baths.\_ It takes a village, so accept any practical help offered, but treat unsolicited advice with a nod and a smile - then follow your gut and the advice of a trusted professional.  \n‍  \nMake sure that anyone wanting to cuddle baby uses [Bennetts® Family Care Hand Sanitiser](https://bennettsforbabies-e4faf7ebae6500404455c.webflow.io/products/bennetts-hand-sanitizer) or [Bennetts® Family Care Hygiene Wipes](https://bennettsforbabies-e4faf7ebae6500404455c.webflow.io/products/bennetts-hygine-wipes) to banish those germs until baby has had his shots and developed some immunity."
