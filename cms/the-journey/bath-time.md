After swimming in amniotic fluid for 9 months, baby’s skin will be dry. He won't need a bath every day at first because he’s not exactly playing in the mud and a bath everyday could strip his skin of precious oils. That said, an evening bath followed by a feed can create a routine that tells baby its night time and settle him for a longer, deeper sleep. Alternatively, a top-and-tail (washing his eyes, mouth and bottom with Bennetts® Baby Wipes) will keep him clean. Bennetts® Baby Bar is a pure glycerine soap that is gentle enough to use at every bath time from birth.
