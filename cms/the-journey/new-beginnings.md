Things can feel overwhelming in the early days until you get to understand what baby is saying with his cries. His needs are simple - love and cuddles, enough clothing to keep warm, milk when he’s hungry, a dry nappy and lots of sleep.  
  
Recreating the  familiar comforting sensations of the womb for the first three months will help baby feel right at home. This means gentle rocking and “shushing”, mimicking the movement and constant sound of the womb, as well as firm swaddling, so baby feels held. Baby will also be soothed by sucking, whether nursing, drinking his bottle or using a dummy.

It’s hard to know how much milk baby is actually getting when breastfeeding, but if he’s putting on weight, wetting five or six nappies a day and making two poos, you’ll know he’s getting enough.
