“I have a 5 month old baby boy, the apple of my eye and he woke up this morning at 3 o’clock with such a bad blocked nose that at first I got a bit worried. Then I grabbed the first aid kit…. Aaaaahh there it is…. Bennetts Eazi Breathe Kit!!! What a Blessing!!!! I first removed all the mucous from his nose with the Bennetts Aspirator. Then applied the Bennetts Eazi Breathe to his chest and upper lip. He obviously was not too happy with me, but soon after he could breathe properly, he was all smiles again. If it was not for these excellent products I would certainly felt very helpless. I dropped my son at the day care centre with no worries or concerns, he was breathing much better and the smiles I got were priceless. I am truly blessed. Thanks to the Bennetts range I can concentrate on enjoying motherhood with the knowledge: Bennetts has my back!”
