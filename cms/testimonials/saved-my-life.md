I really just need to let you know that the Bennetts Colic Mixture literally saved my life when my boy had severe colic. We had him at the doctor twice, had nights that could rival any horror movie and we looked like zombies. Then our pharmacists gave us Bennetts Colic Mixture. Oh my, the difference was unreal… The sun started shining, I could hear the birds singing and above all… the constant crying/screaming stopped and our little baby could sleep again. Thank you!!”
